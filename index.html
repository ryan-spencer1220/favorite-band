    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
      Aqua is a Danish Europop music group, best known for their 1997
      multi-platinum crossover single "Barbie Girl". The group formed in 1989
      and achieved crossover success around the globe in the late 1990s and
      early 2000s. The group released three albums: Aquarium in 1997, Aquarius
      in 2000 and Megalomania in 2011. The group sold an estimated 33 million
      albums and singles, making them the most profitable Danish band ever.[6]

      <span class="years">1989-1995</span>: Formation and Joyspeed Aqua's
      history together dates back to 1989. They were originally called Joyspeed.
      Claus Norreen and Sóren Rasted met in 1989, and throughout the early
      1990s, they wrote songs together. At that time, René Dif was working in
      the Netherlands as a club DJ, and Rasted and Norreen were starting out as
      producers. Rasted and Norreen had won a contest and were hired to produce
      a soundtrack. For some of the songs they hired Dif. The three were brought
      in to make part of the soundtrack for a little-known film titled Frække
      Frida og de frygtløse spioner. The recording of the soundtrack began in
      1993. After getting along well, the trio decided that they would work
      together again on a future project. A few months after the film was
      released, Dif spotted Lene Nystrøm singing on the Norway–Denmark ferry,
      M/S Peter Wessel. He approached her and hired her as the lead singer of
      Joyspeed, later renamed Aqua. The formation of Joyspeed was on the basis
      that both Norreen and Rasted would do the production for the group, with
      Dif rapping and Nystrøm performing the main vocals. A small Swedish record
      label signed them in 1994, and their very first single "Itzy Bitzy Spider"
      was released in Sweden. The single failed to become popular, and after one
      week at the lower end of the Swedish charts, it disappeared completely.
      The four were disappointed and canceled their contract with the record
      label (although the label wanted to keep the group on for further
      releases).

    <p>
      <span class="years">1996-1999</span>: Aquarium and international
      breakthrough With a new manager and no record deal, the group started
      over, and began to develop their famous bubblegum pop sound. The four
      began to produce and write melodic, catchy European pop songs, attracting
      the attention of major label Universal Music Denmark. They renamed
      themselves Aqua, choosing the name seen on a poster for an aquarium in
      their dressing room, and eventually accepted Universal Music Denmark's
      offer of a recording contract in 1996. The group's first release under
      their new name was "Roses Are Red", a dance song with a distinct pop
      sound. It was released in Denmark in September 1996, and was expected to
      break into the Danish top ten. The single far surpassed all expectations
      set by the label, though, and stayed in the charts for over two months,
      eventually selling enough copies to be certified platinum. The success of
      the single was further proven when Aqua received a nomination for "Best
      Danish Dance Act", although the group did not win. The instant success of
      "Roses Are Red" proved to Aqua that their new sound was popular with the
      public, and as a result their follow-up single followed the same formula.
      Titled "My Oh My", the single again featured catchy lyrics paired with a
      soft, melodic beat. Upon its release in February 1997, "My Oh My" broke
      all Danish sales records by being certified gold within six days. The
      single went straight to number one in Denmark, and made Aqua a household
      name in the country. The first two singles proved to Universal Music
      Denmark that Aqua was a very marketable group, and as a result the label
      looked to start marketing their music across the continent. Aqua released
      their debut album Aquarium in Denmark on 26 March 1997. The album
      contained 11 tracks, including their first two singles and their then
      upcoming third single "Barbie Girl". Universal Music Group had by now
      begun to market the group in other countries, releasing "Roses Are Red" in
      Japan in February 1997 and in various countries across Europe in late
      1996. The single had proven popular everywhere it was sold, convincing
      Universal that the group should not just focus on the Danish market, but
      instead on the general European market. Aqua released their third single
      "Barbie Girl" in May 1997. The song, at first glance, appears to be about
      the Barbie doll. However, at a second glance, the song contains several
      sexual overtones, such as "You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere",
      "You can touch, you can play", and "Kiss me here, touch me there,
      hanky-panky." Despite complaints about the double meanings in "Barbie
      Girl", Universal Music released the single around the world in 1997. The
      release was highly successful, making number one in the United Kingdom for
      four weeks, in Australia for three weeks, and making the top ten of the
      Billboard Hot 100, something rarely achieved at the time by European pop
      acts. Aqua released their album Aquarium around the world in the autumn of
      1997. Although the album sold well, many still wrote the group off as a
      one-hit wonder. Despite this, and much criticism from the media, Aqua had
      made their international breakthrough, and were now known around the
      world. Aqua's follow-up to "Barbie Girl" in Australia, Canada and the
      United Kingdom was "Doctor Jones", although another single, "Lollipop
      (Candyman)", was released in the United States through MCA Records.
      "Doctor Jones" entered at number one in several countries, including the
      United Kingdom, where it stayed at the top spot for two weeks, and
      Australia, where it spent seven weeks at #1. "Lollipop (Candyman)" became
      the group's second Top 40 hit in the US, peaking at #23 on the Billboard
      Hot 100. The song peaked at #3 in Australia. In Japan both songs were
      released as a double A-side, and achieved reasonable success in the
      singles chart. "Doctor Jones" was followed up by "Turn Back Time", a song
      which proved to be accepted well by both Aqua fans and critics. The song,
      unlike all other previous releases, dropped the bubblegum pop sound in
      favour of a slow, mainstream rhythm. The song was featured on the
      soundtrack to the film Sliding Doors, and unlike many other Aqua releases
      achieved a large amount of radio and video airplay. The song became their
      third single to make it to number one in the United Kingdom. As of 2005,
      only a handful of other artists have managed to achieve that kind of
      initial success in the UK (acts that have included Westlife and the Spice
      Girls). Elsewhere, the song also performed well, including reaching #10 in
      Australia, however it would not be a success in the US and thus marked the
      end of Aqua's involvement Stateside. Aqua's second Danish single, "My Oh
      My", was resurrected in August 1998. The single was also released in
      several other European countries where it had not been released initially.
      Following the release of "Good Morning Sunshine", which achieved limited
      success, Aqua decided to concentrate on their second album, and on touring
      around Australia. This marked the end of a period Aqua's fans dubbed the
      "Aquarium age". The group also released a documentary on 1 December 1998
      containing several live performances of songs from the Aquarium album and
      interviews with the members.

      <span class="years">1999–2001:</span> Aquarius, Mattel controversy, and
      hiatus Aqua were relatively quiet during 1999, deciding to concentrate on
      recording Aquarius. According to promotional interviews with the group,
      over 30 songs were recorded for the album, although eventually only twelve
      made it onto the final version. The group released their second album
      Aquarius in February 2000. The album instantly proved popular with their
      fan base, despite some changes to their sound. Aquarius contained several
      different musical styles. Tracks such as "Cartoon Heroes" and "Bumble
      Bees" preserved the pop sound of their debut album. "Cartoon Heroes" was
      released as the first single, and sold well across Europe and Australia,
      reaching #1 in Denmark, #7 in the United Kingdom, and #16 in Australia.
      The song is often best remembered for its music video. Aqua released their
      follow-up single "Around the World" in June 2000, although it was not as
      successful as "Cartoon Heroes", peaking at #26 in the UK and #35 in
      Australia. Despite this, it reached the top spot in Denmark. Although not
      expected at the time, "Around the World" would be Aqua's final UK single
      release. Aqua released "Bumble Bees" as a single in Scandinavia, Europe
      and Australia, achieving reasonable success. "We Belong to the Sea"
      followed as a fourth single in even fewer nations, failing to chart in
      most countries. At one stage, "Freaky Friday" was planned as a potential
      follow-up single for release in early 2001, but it was cancelled. Aqua
      then decided that they would concentrate on starting work on their third
      album, as opposed to releasing further singles from Aquarius. Aqua spent
      the first few months of 2001 touring around the world, and working on
      material for their third album. The group also performed at the Eurovision
      Song Contest 2001, collaborating with the Safri Duo and providing the
      music during the voting stages of the competition. This performance also
      caused controversy, as a number of offensive phrases and gestures were
      added during the performance of "Barbie Girl" (which was involved in a
      major lawsuit). During a couple of low-key events in Denmark the group
      performed live versions of songs intended for inclusion on the third
      album, including "Couch Potato" and "Shakin' Stevens Is a Superstar", the
      latter a tribute to the 1980s performer Shakin' Stevens. The songs were
      said to have incorporated a rock sound into their music. In December 2000,
      Mattel filed a lawsuit against the group's record label Mattel v. MCA
      Records, 296 F.3d 894 9th Cir. 2002, claiming that "Barbie Girl" had
      damaged the reputation of the Barbie brand. Judge Alex Kozinski writing
      for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the
      district court finding the use of Mattel's trademark in "Barbie Girl" fell
      within the noncommercial use exemption to the Federal Trademark Dilution
      Act. Judge Kozinski concluded his opinion by writing, "The parties are
      advised to chill."[8]

      <span class="years">2008–2012:</span> Reunion and Megalomania In 2008,
      Aqua reunited and promised a 25-concert tour that was to have commenced in
      the summer. Offers were received by the record company from locations in
      Denmark, Canada, United States and United Kingdom. Aqua finally performed
      8 concerts around Denmark as part of the "Grøn koncert" festival. They
      released their second greatest hits album on 15 June 2009, which includes
      16 old remastered tracks and three new songs: "My Mamma Said", "Live Fast,
      Die Young", and their first single in eight years, "Back to the 80s",
      which was released in Denmark on 25 May 2009.[9] "Back to the 80s" debuted
      at number one in Denmark where it stayed for six weeks, becoming the
      band's fifth number-one single. It has since been certified platinum by
      the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for sales
      of 30,000 copies in Denmark. Aqua has also toured Scandinavia between May
      and August 2009 and performed at several gigs in Germany, United Kingdom
      and France. The greatest hits album was released in North America and many
      European countries on 22 September 2009 and in the UK on 29 September
      2009. Aqua commenced the recording of Megalomania at the beginning of
      2010,[10] scheduled for a release in the spring of 2011.[11] Aqua released
      the album's lead single, "How R U Doin?" on 14 March 2011, after a preview
      of the song was posted onto the band's official Facebook page on 10 March
      2011. Co-written by Thomas Troelsen, the song peaked at number four in
      Denmark, becoming the band's tenth top-ten single. It has since been
      certified gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic
      Industry for sales of 15,000 copies in Denmark.[12] Aqua were originally
      set to release their third studio album on 14 July 2011, however the
      release was pushed back to 5 September 2011 with the record label citing
      bad timing.[13] The album, titled Megalomania, was then further
      rescheduled to be released on 3 October 2011.[14] On 7 September 2011,
      Aqua released a preview of their new single, "Playmate to Jesus", on their
      official Facebook page, which was released on 12 September 2011. On 8
      September 2011, it was announced that "Like a Robot" would also be
      released as a single on 12 September, and would battle against "Playmate
      to Jesus" in the charts. After the moderate chart success of Megalomania
      in Denmark, an expanded version of the band featuring all four original
      members (Lene Nystrøm Rasted, René Dif, Søren Rasted, Claus Norreen), plus
      new additions Niels Lykke Munksgaard Rasmussen (guitar) Frederik Thaae
      (bass) and Morten Hellborn (drums), toured Australia in March 2012. They
      initially announced six concerts but quickly added three additional shows
      to Melbourne, Sydney and Perth (Fremantle) due to popular demand. Aqua
      appeared on Sunrise, an Australian morning TV show on the Seven Network.
      They performed a slower tempo acoustic version of "Barbie Girl" and it was
      revealed that Lene had pneumonia, but the concerts would proceed as the
      group pride themselves on never having cancelled a show. They then
      appeared on the Seven Network's The Morning Show, performing "Doctor
      Jones". After the tour, the band split again. In 2014, the band announced
      a tour in Australia and New Zealand.

    <p>
      <span class="years">2016 - Present:</span> Second reunion In September
      2016, it was announced that Aqua will perform "at least 10 concerts" as
      part of the Vi Elsker 90'erne ("We Love the '90s") music festival. It was
      the first time Aqua performed live in Denmark since 2011.[15] On 20
      September 2016, Aqua announced that Claus Norreen would not return to the
      group. Norreen said in a statement that his "musical focus" has changed
      and that he no longer desires to tour with Aqua, but still considers the
      remaining members of Aqua "his family".[16] On 29 May 2018, Aqua announced
      "The Rewind Tour" in Canada, with fellow '90s acts Prozzäk and
      Whigfield.[17] In June 2018, Aqua released a brand-new single called
      "Rookie". In July 2021 the band released a cover of "I Am What I Am" for
      Copenhagen Pride 2021.[18]
